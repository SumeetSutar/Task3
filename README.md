# Task3
In this task, we performed Linear Regression to predict house prices based on different factors like area, number of bedrooms, and more. First, we cleaned and prepared the data, converted categorical values (like "yes"/"no") into numbers, and split it into training and testing sets.

Then, we trained a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn and made predictions. We evaluated the model using MAE, MSE, and RÂ² score to check how accurate it is. We also plotted the regression line to see how well the model fits the data.

Through this, we learned how to apply linear regression, understand its results, and check model accuracy using real-world housing data.
